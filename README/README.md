# Horiseon Refactored Starter Code

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to refactor the Horiseon home page website in order to polish and be up to date on accessibility standards surrounding the legibility and coherence of the sites code. In doing so it will allow for a more diverse community of coders to better interpret and interact with the code base of the site. Furthermore in examining this code it has illustrated how to improve existing code without having to change the core infastructure but still leaving it in a better legible condition than prior. 

The changes that were included were:
* Semantics were used to better seperate and understand compartments in the index.html.
* Comments were added to both the html and css files.
* Unnecessary id and class attributes were removed from the index.html file.
* Repetative selectors were removed and consolidated into singular selectors in the style css file.
* Alt attributes were added to img elements.
* Selectors were reorganised to better follow the flow of the index.html files semantics.
